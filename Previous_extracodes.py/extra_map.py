# I understand, you want to make the temple, ruins, and cave more random and mysterious for your game. That's a good idea, as it will add more surprise and challenge to your game. Here is a possible list of basic things that you can ask your users to choose from when creating their island layout, without the temple, ruins, and cave:

# - Port: A port is a place where ships can dock and trade goods. You can ask your users if they want a port on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the smallest and 5 is the largest, and you can use directions such as north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, center, etc.
# - Market: A market is a place where people can buy and sell various items and services. You can ask your users if they want a market on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the port.
# - Town: A town is a place where people live and work. You can ask your users if they want a town on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the port and the market.
# - Village: A village is a smaller place than a town where people live and work. You can ask your users if they want a village on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the other places.
# - Farm: A farm is a place where crops are grown and animals are raised. You can ask your users if they want a farm on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the other places.
# - Fort: A fort is a place where soldiers or pirates defend themselves from enemies. You can ask your users if they want a fort on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the other places.
# - Lighthouse: A lighthouse is a tower that emits light to guide ships at sea. You can ask your users if they want a lighthouse on their island, and if yes, how big and on what location of the island they want it. For example, you can use the same scale and directions as for the other places.

# These are some basic things that you can ask your users to choose from when creating their island layout, without the temple, ruins, and cave. Of course, you can also add more options and features to make your island layout more diverse and interesting. I hope this helps you with your game development. Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
